# prepro

small, lua-based preprocessor, found at http://lua-users.org/wiki/SimpleLuaPreprocessor, changed for lua 5.3

just try the examples:

    ./prepro example1

    ./prepro example2

    ./prepro example3

just to show the power of lua, example 3 combines the preprocessor with the data description example from pil, found here: https://www.lua.org/pil/10.1.html
